    {% blocktrans %}
    
    <p>myEWB is Engineers Without Borders Canada's online community!
    We envision this online community as a place where EWB members and non-members alike can connect to discuss human development and EWB's operations.
    EWB is a large, distributed virtual organization and myEWB can help to keep us connected and working together effectively.</p>

    <p>myEWB is also EWB's chapter membership management system, providing EWB chapters with automatic mailing lists and other useful tools.</p>

    <p>
    myEWB is an evolving system, with new features being added all the time to support the EWB community.
    </p>
    
    <p>
    In the past, old features were added slowly but the system was solid and stable; however in the future 
    we see a more agile myEWB where we can experiment and play with new ideas.  This also means that 
    things may not always work perfectly... if you find any problems, please 
    <a href="#" onclick="$("#feedback-dialog-send").click(); return false;">tell us</a>
    and we'll be sure to fix them ASAP!
    </p>

    <h1>The Software</h1>

    <p>The software powering myEWB is an open-source project: see our 
    <a href="http://office.ewb.ca/fastrac/myewb2">project page</a> and
    <a href="http://github.com/ewbcanada/myewb2">GitHub repository</a>.
    It is written in Python, using the <a href="http://djangoproject.com">django</a>
    and <a href="http://pinaxproject.com">pinax</a> projects.
    </p>
    
    <p>If you would like to contribute to the project, give us a shout!</p>
    
    <p>
    The old version of myEWB (myEWB1 or OpenMyEWB, written in Java) is also available 
    <a href="http://nicolas.kruchten.com/openmyewb.html">here</a>.

    	<strong>Known Issues</strong>
    	<br/>
    	
    	<ul>
    		<li>
    			Not all posts come up in searches: myEWB's new internal search engine 
    			is still indexing all of our old content, which will take a couple of days
    			to finish.
    			(we could speed it up, but that would make everything else really slow!).
    		</li>
    		<li>
    			Attached files with filenames over about 30 characters long are causing
    			problems (if you view a post with a file like this, you'll likely get an error).
    			Will be fixed soon!

    	<strong>Recent fixes</strong>
    	<ul>
    		<li>
    			Guests were able to create/edit whiteboards - oops! (was causing blank-
    			page errors earlier)<br/>
    			<em>Fixed May 22</em>
    		</li>
    		<li>
    			Some whiteboards were not migrated properly and wouldn't save<br/>
    			<em>Fixed May 21</em>
